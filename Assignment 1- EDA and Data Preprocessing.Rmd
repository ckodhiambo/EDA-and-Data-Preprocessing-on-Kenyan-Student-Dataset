#Why might these variables have missing data in a Kenyan context?
```
Why These Might Be Missing (Contextual Insight):
Family Income (5%) -Sensitive financial info; students may not know or may avoid sharing.
‚Üí In Kenya, discussing income is often culturally sensitive, especially in lower-income or rural households.
‚Üí Students may also not be aware of exact figures.

Attendance Rate (5%) -Could be due to poor record-keeping or informal school systems.
‚Üí Many schools (especially rural) lack digitized records; paper-based systems often have gaps.
‚Üí Could also reflect inconsistent attendance tracking.

Math Score (3%) -Could be ungraded students, recent transfers, or exam absences.
‚Üí Students who missed exams due to illness, unpaid fees, or transfer cases.
‚Üí Some schools might not submit complete results.

Academic Performance (7.82%) -May be missing if performance is yet to be evaluated or withheld.
‚Üí Could be missing if students are newly admitted, assessments are pending, or results are withheld due to fees.

```{r Q10: Impute family_income and math_score with median}
# Impute family_income with median
median_income <- median(data$family_income, na.rm = TRUE)
data$family_income[is.na(data$family_income)] <- median_income

# Impute math_score with median
median_math <- median(data$math_score, na.rm = TRUE)
data$math_score[is.na(data$math_score)] <- median_math

```

‚úÖ Why Use the Median?
Robust to outliers:
Income and exam scores can have extreme values (e.g., very high earners or top scorers). The median is not affected by these outliers, making it more robust than the mean.

Skewed distributions:
Both family_income and math_score are often right-skewed (especially income). The median better represents the center of such distributions.

```{r Q11: Impute attendance_rate with mean + Histogram}
# Histogram before imputation
data |> ggplot(aes(attendance_rate)) +
      geom_histogram(fill = "skyblue", color = "black", na.rm = TRUE) +
      labs(title = "Attendance Rate Before Imputation", x = "Attendance Rate", y = "Count")

# Impute missing values with the mean
data$attendance_rate[is.na(data$attendance_rate)] <- mean(data$attendance_rate, na.rm = TRUE)

# Histogram after imputation
data |> ggplot(aes(attendance_rate)) +
        geom_histogram(fill = "tomato", color = "black") +
        labs(title = "Attendance Rate After Imputation", x = "Attendance Rate", y = "Count")

```
üìù Why Use the Mean Here?
attendance_rate is a continuous variable.

The distribution is typically symmetric or mildly skewed for attendance.

Mean imputation retains the central tendency and is acceptable when the missingness is random and small in proportion (5% in your case).

```{r Compare the distributions before and after imputation using histograms.}
# Copy of original attendance_rate before imputation
data$attendance_rate_original <- data$attendance_rate

#Impute missing values using the mean
data$attendance_rate[is.na(data$attendance_rate)] <- mean(data$attendance_rate, na.rm = TRUE)

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Prepare data for plotting
attendance_df <- data |> 
    select(attendance_rate_original, attendance_rate) |> 
    pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Version", values_to = "Rate") |> 
    mutate(Version = recode(Version,
                          "attendance_rate_original" = "Before Imputation",
                          "attendance_rate" = "After Imputation"))

# Plot overlaid histograms
ggplot(attendance_df, aes(x = Rate, fill = Version)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "identity", alpha = 0.5, bins = 30) +
  labs(title = "Overlayed Histograms of Attendance Rate",
       x = "Attendance Rate", y = "Count") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("steelblue", "orange")) +
  theme_minimal()


```
Statistical Impact
Visual inspection will show a small peak at the mean value in the "After Imputation" version due to imputed entries.

Effect on distribution is minor if missingness is small (~5%), but the tail behavior may be slightly compressed.

Since the mean preserves overall central tendency, it's acceptable when data is fairly symmetric ‚Äî if highly skewed, median is safer.

#Data Preprocessing: Outliers
```{r Q12: Detect Outliers (IQR method)}
# Compute Q1, Q3, and IQR
Q1 <- quantile(data$family_income, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)
Q3 <- quantile(data$family_income, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)
IQR<- Q3 - Q1

# Define outlier thresholds
lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

# Detect outliers
outliers <- length(data$family_income[data$family_income < lower_bound | data$family_income > upper_bound])

# Print results
cat("Number of outliers in family income:", outliers, "\n")

#what might they represent in a Kenyan context?
```
üß† Interpretation of outliers in family_income may represent:

High-income families in affluent areas (e.g., Nairobi suburbs, expatriate households, upper-class).

Low outliers may reflect students from marginalized or rural communities.

Could indicate data entry errors (e.g., extra zero added or wrong currency).

Socioeconomic inequality is pronounced in Kenya, so such income variation is realistic and informative.
